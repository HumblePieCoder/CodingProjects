    "\n",
    "**Deadline.** This project is due at 11:59pm P.T. on Thursday, 2/25. Projects will be accepted up to 2 days (48 hours) late; a project submitted less than 24 hours after the deadline will receive 2/3 credit, a project submitted between 24 and 48 hours after the deadline will receive 1/3 credit, and a project submitted 48 hours or more after the deadline will receive no credit. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.** For full credit on the checkpoint, you must also complete the first 8 questions, pass all public autograder tests, and submit to okpy by 11:59pm P.T. on Friday, 2/19. This is worth 1 point of your entire project grade. After you've submitted the checkpoint, you may still change your answers before the project deadline - only your final submission will be graded for correctness. You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab and leave time to finish the checkpoint afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner; your partner must be from your assigned lab section. Only one of you is required to submit the project. On [okpy.org](http://okpy.org), the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit. Feel free to split up the work between your partner, share what you complete with each other in a google document, and share your screen in a Zoom call as you work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your discussion TA or tutor for help. You can find contact information for the staff on the [course website](http://data8.org/sp21/staff.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** The tests that are given are **not comprehensive** and passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work! You might want to create your own checks along the way to see if your answers make sense. Additionally, before you submit, make sure that none of your cells take a very long time to run (several minutes). Each question is worth 1 point of your total project grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Free Response Questions:** Make sure that you put the answers to the written questions in the indicated cell we provide. **Every free response question should include an explanation** that adequately answers the question. Check to make sure that you have a [Gradescope](http://gradescope.com) account, which is where the scores to the free response questions will be posted. If you do not, make sure to reach out to your assigned (u)GSI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. For example, in Question 1 of the Global Poverty section, we ask you to assign an answer to `latest`. Do not reassign the variable name `latest` to anything else in your notebook, otherwise there is the chance that our tests grade against what `latest` was reassigned to.\n",
    "\n",
    "You **never** have to use just one line in this project or any others. Use intermediate variables and multiple lines as much as you would like!  \n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, load `datascience`, `numpy`, `plots`, and `ok`."

    "The trends in life expectancy do not explain why the population growth rate decreased. As shown by graph, Haiti's mortality conditions have slowly been decreasing each year, meaning that more people throughout all ages are staying alive longer on average each year. Life expectancy at birth has increased from around 50 to 65 years old, from 1980 to 2020, respectively. One would assume that this trend would lead to an increase in the population growth rate rather than a decrease. In 2010 there was a catastophic earthquake in Haiti, which would drastically increase mortalities across all ages for that year. This earthquake does not explain the population's overall growth rate change because Haiti's life expectancy quickly regained an upward trend back to pre-2010 levels."

Since around 1980 the amount of children birthed on average by a woman has steadily decreased from a little over six to a little less than 3 kids. \"Chilren per woman\" has been cut in half.

The link has been attributed to family planning: if parents can expect that their children will all survive into adulthood, then they will choose to have fewer children. We can see if this association is evident in Haiti by plotting the relationship between total fertility rate and [child mortality rate per 1000 children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_mortality)."

    "There is as general positive association between child mortality and children per woman. As child mortality decreases (as we go down vertically in the scatter plot), there are fewer children being produced and the points go farther to the left. There is one outlier on the plot worth investigating at around 3.3 children per woman, which has an astronomically high child mortality rate (210) compared to the other points around it."

The table it returns should have four columns: `geo`, `population_total`, `children_per_woman_total_fertility`, and `child_mortality_under_5_per_1000_born`. Each row should contain one Alpha-3 country code and three statistics: population, fertility rate, and child mortality for that `year` from the `population`, `fertility` and `child_mortality` tables. Only include rows for which all three statistics are available for the country and year.\n",

The `population` column contains the total population of all countries included in the result of `stats_for_year(year)` for the first `year` of the decade.
